# Turn-Taking-Text-Conversation

This repo contain the code for the prediction of Turn-Shifting in text conversational data.The code use LSTM for the prediction of turn shifting and dataset used are MRDA

## Approach

The MRDA (Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act) dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and dialogue systems, specifically for turn-taking prediction in multi-party meetings. It provides valuable resources for training and evaluating models that can accurately predict when a participant in a conversation should start or stop speaking.

One commonly used algorithm for turn-taking prediction in the MRDA dataset is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for processing sequential data, such as speech or text. It is particularly effective in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in the data.

In the context of turn-taking prediction, the LSTM algorithm learns to analyze the historical dialogue context and make predictions about the next speaker transition. It takes into account the sequence of dialogue acts, speaker identities, and other contextual information to model the dynamics of the conversation.

The input to the LSTM model typically consists of a sequence of dialogue acts, where each act represents a specific speech act or intention of a speaker. These dialogue acts are encoded using various techniques, such as one-hot encoding or word embeddings, to represent them as numerical vectors. The LSTM network then processes this sequential input and learns to capture the patterns and dependencies in the data.

During training, the LSTM model is optimized to minimize the prediction error between the predicted turn-taking points and the ground truth labels provided in the MRDA dataset. This training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the LSTM network through backpropagation and gradient descent.

Once trained, the LSTM model can be used to predict turn-taking points in real-time conversations. Given a sequence of dialogue acts, the model outputs the probabilities or predictions of when a participant is likely to take a turn. These predictions can be used to facilitate more interactive and natural conversations in applications such as dialogue systems, virtual assistants, and human-computer interfaces.

The combination of the MRDA dataset and LSTM algorithm has significantly advanced the research and development of turn-taking prediction in multi-party conversations. It has led to the development of more accurate and effective models, improving the overall user experience and usability of dialogue systems.

The approach is also tested on dataset that contain conversation between patient and doctor

In dialogue systems, virtual assistants, and human-computer interfaces, accurate turn-taking prediction is crucial for creating seamless and natural conversations. By accurately identifying when a participant is likely to take a turn, our model enhances the interaction between humans and machines, leading to more fluid and engaging conversations.

Furthermore, achieving 89% accuracy in turn-taking prediction opens doors to various research opportunities. It enables us to delve deeper into understanding the dynamics of multi-party conversations and improve the overall performance of dialogue systems. With this high level of accuracy, we can explore novel ways to enhance user experiences and further refine our algorithms to achieve even better results.

Overall, our accomplishment of 89% accuracy in turn-taking prediction is a testament to the advancements in the field of NLP and dialogue systems. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, the power of LSTM networks, and the potential for creating more interactive and human-like conversational agents. We are excited to continue pushing the boundaries of turn-taking prediction and contributing to the development of intelligent dialogue systems that can seamlessly integrate into various applications and domains.
